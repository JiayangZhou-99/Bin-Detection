# Bin-Detection

This project focuses on using the logistic regresion based image pixel classification model and image reinforcement methods to segment and augment images and then detected the positions of the bins in different images. As bins may appear in different places, it is necessary to design a classification algorithm that can segment the bin from a complex scenario. My method achieved a reliable outcome on detecting the location of bins in different scenarios.
